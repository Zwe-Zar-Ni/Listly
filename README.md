## 🚀 About Me
Sup! I'm a software developer specializing in frontend development (web and mobile). I work mostly with JavaScript, Vue, React, Next.js, and React Native. I enjoy building clean and user-friendly interfaces.

Right now, I'm working at a Japanese telecom company based in Tokyo, Japan. I love solving problems, learning new things, and improving my skills every day. When I’m not coding, I like to explore new tech, work out, and focus on self-improvement.

Always open to new ideas and challenges! 🚀
